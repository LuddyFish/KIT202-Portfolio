            I thought this weeks beginner tut was an excellent way to get into HTML (and Git). 
            The tutorial work was fairly simple to get through with clear instructions and had 
            a diverse range of tasks to complete. Although, some tasks towards the end were a 
            bit more fiddly to work with. I had to go look up how to do some of the tasks like
            how do I make all the form elements mandatory and password specifications? I didn't 
            need to use ChatGPT to find out as there were plenty of sources to help me discover
            the answer and I was able to make sense of how they worked, especially considering
            most of this is still basic stuff. Maybe I wasn't supposed to do them just yet, but
            I still did them anyway because I like to do everything that's there. 
            I also liked how we were given examples of what our finished page should look like, 
            as it was another source of trying to match it based on your current knowledge 
            without needing to refer to the activity manual (asides from the tasks with 
            specifications).<br>
            It was a little challenging trying to set up with Gitea with ictteach. I am familar
            with Git already, so I was ready to create a new repository on GitHub, but I do like
            how most things are already set up for us to avoid potential issues, which I know
            many who are inexperienced will make. I ended up losing all my finished progess on
            `index.html` because of a failed save, which was a pain to recover. 
            Hopefully the team stuff goes all well without too many (if any) hiccups. Having
            had some disasterous experiences with version control in the past, I hope to avoid 
            repeating those occurances at all costs.
