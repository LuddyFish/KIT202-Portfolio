                    I thought this weeks beginner tut was an excellent way to get into HTML (and Git). 
                    The tutorial work was fairly simple to get through with clear instructions and had 
                    a diverse range of tasks to complete. Although, some tasks towards the end were a 
                    bit more fiddly to work with. I had to go look up how to do some of the tasks like
                    how do I make all the form elements mandatory and password specifications? I didn't 
                    need to use ChatGPT to find out as there were plenty of sources to help me discover
                    the answer and I was able to make sense of how they worked, especially considering
                    most of this is still basic stuff. Maybe I wasn't supposed to do them just yet, but
                    I still did them anyway because I like to do everything that's there. 
                    I also liked how we were given examples of what our finished page should look like, 
                    as it was another source of trying to match it based on your current knowledge 
                    without needing to refer to the activity manual (asides from the tasks with 
                    specifications).<br>
                    It was a little challenging trying to set up with Gitea with ictteach. I am familar
                    with Git already, so I was ready to create a new repository on GitHub, but I do like
                    how most things are already set up for us to avoid potential issues, which I know
                    many who are inexperienced will make. I ended up losing all my finished progess on
                    `index.html` because of a failed save, which was a pain to recover. 
                    Hopefully the team stuff goes all well without too many (if any) hiccups. Having
                    had some disasterous experiences with version control in the past, I hope to avoid 
                    repeating those occurances at all costs.

                <h2 class="content" id="three">Week 3</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial was quite fun in "dressing up" the page to make it look nice. 
                    It was a little confusing having to read instructions from different sources (MyLO
                    and the .css file) while simultaneously having to update the .html files to 
                    accommodate the CSS changes. I feel like it was better if I read through the whole
                    MyLO page instructions before I started working on the .css file. There is also a
                    lot of things to read over in the .css file, which is all fine but the structure of
                    some comments change which throws me in for a loop because it's easy to gloss over
                    instructions. The registration form  was the main one as it threw me off because I
                    completely missed the part where it told me display the form as a grid layout. I
                    got through it all in the end though.<br>
                    One thing I did learn this week is to be careful when using commas. I knew to be
                    careful of using spaces in CSS, but I was confused on why margins and paddings were
                    not displaying as they should, until I realised that the commas were causing the
                    rest of numbers to be ignored. It's a little confusing because there are some parts
                    that require commas, but at least I now know the importance of not using commas for
                    the important styles.
                </p>
                <h2 class="content" id="four">Week 4</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial was fairly straightforward. I thought the process of 
                    accommodating different devices (desktop vs mobile) would be a lot more tedious,
                    but the <code>@media</code> rule in CSS makes it a really easy process. Only a few 
                    things needed updating, although I pressume part of that is because of the good CSS
                    styling habits prepared for us, avoiding tedious backtracking.<br>
                    The testimonials activity was fun. I considered pulling a whole lot of lines form
                    my novel but I went against it as I'd have to be going through pages to find quotes
                    that are in no way related to marathons. And besides, I already took the pleasure
                    of making the authors some of my favourite characters that I grew up with as a child.
                    <span style="color:green"> Perhaps I could've quoted one of their lines? Maybe I'll 
                    go back and do that... (painting text green as a potential TODO reminder)</span>.<br>
                    I didn't quite fully get the A11y lighthouse stuff as my results turned nearly all 
                    perfect. I understand it's function though and I'm sure if I was to encounter some 
                    proper suggested errors, I would understand what it's trying to tell me. All the 
                    stuff from the lectorial on Wednesday made sense.

                <h2 class="content" id="five">Week 5</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial work with JavaScript was quite simple and straightforward. I felt 
                    really in the zone with how similar it is to other languages such as C, Java, etc. So, 
                    I didn't really learn much because I was already confident with most of the work here. 
                    It was a little tricky getting my head around the concept 
                    <code>document.getElementById("id").innerHTML</code> but once I saw it in action, 
                    things started to click.<br>
                    Seeing how JavaScript works with HTML now though, I have some ideas in trying to 
                    incorporate it such as making a default header/footer style rather than having to copy 
                    and paste huge chunks of code.
                </p>
                <h2 class="content" id="six">Week 6</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial was quite complex to follow. There was a whole lot of things thrown
                    onto us and it felt like we were just given the goal without being told how to get there.
                    I first stated out by doing simple <code>if</code> statements, but I realised that the
                    code became quite restricted in its functionality, unable to remove the error messages
                    if the user updated the input correctly. I walked back into Week 5 and decided to create
                    a massive array (<code>checks</code>), which provided great flexibility in what I could 
                    do. Getting my head around it was a little tricky because of all the requirements, so 
                    I'm not sure if that was what I was supposed to do or not, but if it was, a guide going
                    through how to build it would've been helpful. From there though, the rest was much
                    easier with the foundation laid out. I wanted to try and push myself a little more to
                    make the form more dynamic by making the form grid change from 2 to 3 columns and vice
                    versa. I had to rearrange some functions to ensure that this could work properly and
                    not screw up the whole form format. But I got there in the end.<br>
                    Learning how to use <code>querySelector()</code> makes calling for classes, ids, and
                    names so much easier. Being able to use it, but more specifically <code>classList</code>
                    and <code>style</code> to add, remove, and modify CSS styling opens things up in a
                    dynamic sense.<br>
                    I also figured out that you could nest "ternary operators" within each other, making for
                    some interesting and complex <code>if/else</code> statements. It does get messy to read
                    though, so I needed to add parentheses to help make it more readable.

                <h2 class="content" id="seven">Week 7</h2>
                <p>
                    There is not much to talk about this week as things were quite light on. It was useful
                    learning that the <code>action</code> attribute can used to take the user out of the
                    registration form and to wherever they need to go next, instead of keeping them on the
                    same page. It's amazing how it's kind of an expected quality of life now to have
                    feedback when you press "submit". The <code>method</code> attribute is also useful for
                    knowing how and where data is stored, and it was quite fun to play around with. Both
                    of these will be quite useful for the assignment blog posts in the future, but the 
                    <code>action</code> attribute was implemented this week.

                <h2 class="content" id="eight">Week 8</h2>
                <p>
                    Not much to talk about this week other than that it this week's tutorial was a 
                    refresher on ER diagrams. All of the work was pretty familiar and easy to wrap my
                    head around. The only real challenge I had was trying to create foreign keys in 
                    phpMyAdmin, but I eventually figured it out with guidance from the tutorial.
                </p>
                <h2 class="content" id="nine">Week 9</h2>
                <p>
                    For this week's tutorial, it was very much a repeat of the JavaScript tutorial, but
                    using the PHP language instead. I found it really straightforward to get into, and I
                    found the tutorial work to be too easy. There's more stuff I wish we could've gone
                    over, such as the implementation of using PHP to copy <code>header, nav, footer</code>
                    because that seems extremely useful.

                <h2 class="content first" id="a1">Assignment 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I am quite happy with how my group's assignment 1 turned out. It is a beautiful,
                    yet simple and clean blogging site that has it's own personality.<br>
                    Working together was a little challenging in the sense that all our group members
                    understood what needed to be done, but it also removed a lot of communication as 
                    we worked a lot off of vibes and a lot of trust, which did turn out well, and we 
                    rarely needed each other's help when we got to work on certain tasks. We did often
                    say what we had completed to each other in our Discord group chat and we did talk
                    about ideas during our tutorial class together. The only real downside to us not
                    working more collaboratively was that we didn't really know how each other's page 
                    designs functioned, so unless we took the time to look at them for ourselves, we
                    were going on full trust mode. We did manage to create our baseline standards from 
                    the beginning, such as colour choices, fonts, and formatting, but some
                    inconsistencies did slip through like certain buttons not being the same colour.
                    But other than those few things, I would believe that we were generally ok and
                    fine with the level of communication we had.<br>
                    What I found most interesting with using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the
                    blog was how much freedom and possibilities we had. There's still a few more
                    design choices that I'd like to implement for assignment 2 just because we didn't 
                    have the time to implement everything. From what I've experienced, HTML is the 
                    skeleton to it all. Add in CSS, and you can shape and modify the contents to your 
                    heart's content. I didn't even realise animation was possible with CSS, which was 
                    fun to play around with. And to top it off, JavaScript being able to read and
                    change the design of things based on user inputs makes it a whole lot more
                    interactive. With the three of them, any website design is virtually limitless,
                    and it impresses me that you can design any website for visual purposes with just 
                    them.<br> 
                    The only thing left is to do the backend where all the data is stored.
