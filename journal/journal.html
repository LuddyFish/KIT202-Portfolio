                    I thought this weeks beginner tut was an excellent way to get into HTML (and Git). 
                    The tutorial work was fairly simple to get through with clear instructions and had 
                    a diverse range of tasks to complete. Although, some tasks towards the end were a 
                    bit more fiddly to work with. I had to go look up how to do some of the tasks like
                    how do I make all the form elements mandatory and password specifications? I didn't 
                    need to use ChatGPT to find out as there were plenty of sources to help me discover
                    the answer and I was able to make sense of how they worked, especially considering
                    most of this is still basic stuff. Maybe I wasn't supposed to do them just yet, but
                    I still did them anyway because I like to do everything that's there. 
                    I also liked how we were given examples of what our finished page should look like, 
                    as it was another source of trying to match it based on your current knowledge 
                    without needing to refer to the activity manual (asides from the tasks with 
                    specifications).<br>
                    It was a little challenging trying to set up with Gitea with ictteach. I am familar
                    with Git already, so I was ready to create a new repository on GitHub, but I do like
                    how most things are already set up for us to avoid potential issues, which I know
                    many who are inexperienced will make. I ended up losing all my finished progess on
                    `index.html` because of a failed save, which was a pain to recover. 
                    Hopefully the team stuff goes all well without too many (if any) hiccups. Having
                    had some disasterous experiences with version control in the past, I hope to avoid 
                    repeating those occurances at all costs.

                <h2>Week 3</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial was quite fun in "dressing up" the page to make it look nice. 
                    It was a little confusing having to read instructions from different sources (MyLO
                    and the .css file) while simultaneously having to update the .html files to 
                    accommodate the CSS changes. I feel like it was better if I read through the whole
                    MyLO page instructions before I started working on the .css file. There is also a
                    lot of things to read over in the .css file, which is all fine but the structure of
                    some comments change which throws me in for a loop because it's easy to gloss over
                    instructions. The registration form  was the main one as it threw me off because I
                    completely missed the part where it told me display the form as a grid layout. I
                    got through it all in the end though.<br>
                    One thing I did learn this week is to be careful when using commas. I knew to be
                    careful of using spaces in CSS, but I was confused on why margins and paddings were
                    not displaying as they should, until I realised that the commas were causing the
                    rest of numbers to be ignored. It's a little confusing because there are some parts
                    that require commas, but at least I now know the importance of not using commas for
                    the important styles.

                <h2>Week 4</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's tutorial was fairly straightforward. I thought the process of 
                    accommodating different devices (desktop vs mobile) would be a lot more tedious,
                    but the `@media` rule in CSS makes it a really easy process. Only a few things
                    needed updating, although I pressume part of that is because of the good CSS
                    styling habits prepared for us, avoiding tedious backtracking.<br>
                    The testimonials activity was fun. I considered pulling a whole lot of lines form
                    my novel but I went against it as I'd have to be going through pages to find quotes
                    that are in no way related to marathons. And besides, I already took the pleasure
                    of making the authors some of my favourite 2000-10 characters that I grew up with
                    as a child. <span style="color:green"> Perhaps I could've quoted one of their 
                    lines? Maybe I'll go back and do that... (painting text green as a potential TODO 
                    reminder)</span>.<br>
                    I didn't quite fully get the A11y stuff as my results turned nearly all perfect.
                    I understand it's function though and I'm sure if I was to encounter some proper
                    suggested errors, I would understand what it's trying to tell me. All the stuff
                    from the lectorial on Wednesday made sense.
