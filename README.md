This repository contains all the tutorial work that was expected of completition. There are other private repositories that store data for Assignments 1 and 2 (mentioned in the journal), which is the same work but focus on the frontend and backend of web development respectively. If you'd like to view either one of them, please contact me (you would have my email if I was happy to grant you access).
